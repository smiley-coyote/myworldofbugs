        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by plants, animals, and insects around me. 
        As a child, I poured over insect fieldguides, spending my free time searching for them outside of my house. 
        At one point, I even wanted to be an entomologist when I grew up.
        </p>
        <p>
        Though I didn't end up becoming an entomologist, I did buy a DSLR camera with a macro lens while in college 
        so that I could take photos of insects close up. 
        Macro pictures of insects are fascinating because they gave us a small glimpse into their world.
        </p>

        I received inspiration building this game from the summer months I spent as a child catching and observing bugs
        in my backyard. I hope that you enjoy playing this game as much as I did building it.

        <p>My World of Bugs was created in React with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. All of the animated insects were created using <a href="https://vectr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vectr.com</a>â€™s free online vector graphics creation tool.</p>

        <p>The pictures of the insects were taken with a Canon T4i DSLR with a macro lens. 
        They were all spotted around my yard in Central Florida.
