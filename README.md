# My World of Bugs

Welcome to My World of Bugs - a game about catching bugs and learning.

How To Play:

1. Find and catch the correct insect
2. Every mouse click costs 1 stamina
3. Click on a mushroom to regain stamina
4. Catch 5 insects to win, but don't run out of stamina!

My World of Bugs was created in React with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
All of the animated insects were created using [vectr.com](https://vectr.com/)'s 
free online vector graphics creation tool.

The pictures of the insects were taken with a Canon T4i DSLR with a macro lens. 
They were all spotted around my yard in Central Florida.
